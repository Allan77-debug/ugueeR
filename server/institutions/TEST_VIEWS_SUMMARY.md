- ✅ Non-existent institution handling

### 9. Driver Rejection (`RejectDriverView`)

- ✅ Successful driver rejection

- ✅ Non-existent driver handling
- ✅ Non-existent institution handling

## Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Tests cover both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- Validates proper error responses for unauthorized access
- Tests institution-specific access controls

### Data Validation

- Comprehensive validation testing for all required fields
- Email format validation
- Duplicate email/phone validation
- Missing field validation

### Business Logic Testing

- User state transitions (pending → approved/rejected)
- Driver state transitions (pending → approved/rejected)
- Institution-user relationship validation
- Driver application workflow testing

### Error Handling

- 400 Bad Request for validation errors
- 401 Unauthorized for authentication failures
- 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- 404 Not Found for non-existent resources

## Test Data Setup

### Institutions

- Test institution (approved)
- Pending institution
- Empty institution (no users)
- Non-existent institution scenarios

### Users

- Regular approved user
- Pending user (for approval/rejection tests)
- Driver user (for driver approval tests)
- Driver user for rejection (separate from approval)
- Approved driver user (for already approved scenarios)

### Drivers

- Pending driver (for approval tests)
- Pending driver for rejection (separate instance)
- Approved driver (for already approved scenarios)

## Environment Considerations

### Database

- Uses SQLite for testing (same as other apps)
- Handles unique constraints properly
- Manages foreign key relationships correctly

### Model Relationships

- Institution ↔ Users (One-to-Many)
- Users ↔ Driver (One-to-One with primary key)
- Proper handling of primary key relationships

## Running Tests

### Individual App Tests

```bash
cd server/institutions
source ../env/bin/activate
python run_tests.py
```

### All Tests

```bash
cd server
source env/bin/activate
python manage.py test institutions.tests
```

## Test Patterns

### Setup Pattern

```python
def setUp(self):
    # Create test institutions
    # Create test users with different states
    # Create test drivers
    # Create JWT tokens for authentication
```

### API Testing Pattern

```python
def test_view_success(self):
    response = self.client.post('/api/endpoint/', data, format='json')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, expected_status)
    self.assertIn('expected_field', response.data)
```

### State Validation Pattern

```python
def test_state_transition(self):
    # Make API call
    # Refresh from database
    # Assert state changes
    self.assertEqual(user.user_state, expected_state)
```

## Best Practices

### Test Isolation

- Each test method is independent
- Proper cleanup in setUp/tearDown
- No test dependencies

### Realistic Data

- Uses realistic test data
- Proper field validation
- Correct model relationships

### Error Scenarios

- Comprehensive error testing
- Edge case coverage
- Boundary condition testing

### Documentation

- Clear test method names
- Descriptive docstrings
- Comments explaining complex scenarios

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows across multiple views
2. **Performance Tests**: Test with large datasets
3. **Security Tests**: Test for common vulnerabilities
4. **API Documentation**: Generate API docs from tests

### Additional Test Cases

1. **Bulk Operations**: Test bulk user approval/rejection
2. **Concurrent Access**: Test race conditions
3. **Data Migration**: Test model changes
4. **API Versioning**: Test backward compatibility

## Integration with Other Apps

### Dependencies

- `users` app: User model and states
- `driver` app: Driver model and validation
- `django.contrib.auth`: Password hashing

### Cross-App Testing

- Tests validate cross-app relationships
- Ensures data consistency across apps
- Tests business logic that spans multiple models

## Conclusion

The institutions app view tests provide comprehensive coverage for all institution-related functionality, ensuring:

- ✅ **Reliability**: All critical paths are tested
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented tests
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new test cases
- ✅ **Quality**: High test coverage with realistic scenarios

The test suite serves as both documentation and validation for the institutions app's API endpoints, ensuring that all institution management workflows function correctly.
