- ✅ Missing driver record handling

### 3. Vehicle Deletion (`VehicleDeleteView`)

- ✅ Successful vehicle deletion by owner
- ✅ Pending driver attempting deletion (should fail)
- ✅ Regular user attempting deletion (should fail)
- ✅ Unauthorized access handling
- ✅ Non-existent vehicle handling
- ✅ Wrong owner attempting deletion
- ✅ Missing driver record handling

### 4. Vehicle Detail (`VehicleDetailView`)

- ✅ Successful vehicle detail retrieval by owner
- ✅ Pending driver attempting retrieval (should fail)
- ✅ Regular user attempting retrieval (should fail)
- ✅ Unauthorized access handling
- ✅ Non-existent vehicle handling
- ✅ Wrong owner attempting retrieval

## Key Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- Tests cover both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
- Validates proper error responses for unauthorized access
- Tests driver-specific access controls (approved vs pending drivers)
- Tests vehicle ownership validation

### Data Validation

- Comprehensive validation testing for all required fields
- Plate uniqueness validation
- Category constraint validation (database level)
- Capacity field behavior testing
- Document date validation

### Business Logic Testing

- Driver state validation (approved vs pending)
- Vehicle ownership validation
- Driver record existence validation
- Vehicle existence validation

### Error Handling

- 400 Bad Request for validation errors
- 403 Forbidden for authorization failures
- 404 Not Found for non-existent resources
- 500 Internal Server Error for database constraint violations

## Test Data Setup

### Institutions

- Test institution (approved)

### Users

- Approved driver user (can create/manage vehicles)
- Pending driver user (cannot create/manage vehicles)
- Regular user (not a driver, cannot access vehicle features)

### Drivers

- Approved driver (can perform all vehicle operations)
- Pending driver (limited access)
- Missing driver scenarios

### Vehicles

- Test vehicles for approved driver
- Multiple vehicles for testing listing
- Vehicles for ownership testing

## Environment Considerations

### Database

- Uses SQLite for testing (same as other apps)
- Handles unique constraints properly
- Manages foreign key relationships correctly
- Database-level constraint testing

### Model Relationships

- Institution ↔ Users (One-to-Many)
- Users ↔ Driver (One-to-One with primary key)
- Driver ↔ Vehicle (One-to-Many)
- Proper handling of primary key relationships

## Running Tests

### Individual App Tests

```bash
cd server/vehicle
source ../env/bin/activate
python run_tests.py
```

### All Tests

```bash
cd server
source env/bin/activate
python manage.py test vehicle.tests
```

## Test Patterns

### Setup Pattern

```python
def setUp(self):
    # Create test institution
    # Create test users with different driver states
    # Create test drivers
    # Create test vehicles
    # Create JWT tokens for authentication
```

### API Testing Pattern

```python
def test_view_success(self):
    self.client.credentials(HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=f'Bearer {token}')
    response = self.client.post('/api/endpoint/', data, format='json')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, expected_status)
    self.assertIn('expected_field', response.data)
```

### Authorization Testing Pattern

```python
def test_unauthorized_access(self):
    response = self.client.post('/api/endpoint/', data, format='json')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)
```

## Best Practices

### Test Isolation

- Each test method is independent
- Proper cleanup in setUp/tearDown
- No test dependencies

### Realistic Data

- Uses realistic test data
- Proper field validation
- Correct model relationships

### Error Scenarios

- Comprehensive error testing
- Edge case coverage
- Boundary condition testing

### Documentation

- Clear test method names
- Descriptive docstrings
- Comments explaining complex scenarios

## Model Constraints

### Vehicle Model Constraints

- **Category Constraint**: Only allows 'intermunicipal', 'metropolitano', 'campus'
- **Plate Uniqueness**: Plate field must be unique
- **Driver Relationship**: Must belong to a Driver

### Constraint Testing

- Database-level constraint violations return 500 errors
- Serializer-level validations return 400 errors
- Proper error message handling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Integration Tests**: Test complete vehicle-driver workflows
2. **Performance Tests**: Test with large vehicle datasets
3. **Security Tests**: Test for common vulnerabilities
4. **API Documentation**: Generate API docs from tests

### Additional Test Cases

1. **Bulk Operations**: Test bulk vehicle operations
2. **Concurrent Access**: Test race conditions
3. **Data Migration**: Test model changes
4. **API Versioning**: Test backward compatibility

## Integration with Other Apps

### Dependencies

- `users` app: User model and driver states
- `driver` app: Driver model and validation
- `institutions` app: Institution model for user relationships

### Cross-App Testing

- Tests validate cross-app relationships
- Ensures data consistency across apps
- Tests business logic that spans multiple models

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- JWT token-based authentication
- Proper token validation
- Unauthorized access prevention

### Authorization

- Driver state validation
- Vehicle ownership validation
- Role-based access control

### Data Protection

- Vehicle ownership verification
- Driver record validation
- Proper error message handling

## Conclusion

The vehicle app view tests provide comprehensive coverage for all vehicle-related functionality, ensuring:

- ✅ **Reliability**: All critical paths are tested
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented tests
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new test cases
- ✅ **Quality**: High test coverage with realistic scenarios
- ✅ **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization testing

The test suite serves as both documentation and validation for the vehicle app's API endpoints, ensuring that all vehicle management workflows function correctly and securely.
